Grids for Editing
=================


Low
---

- Re-ordering

- Drag-and-drop (from one group to another)

- Some people won't have permission to edit/operate

Notes
-----

- Swipe left won't work, as it is scroll left for seeing columns that
  aren't in the viewport

- Single-tap on cell in unselected row is different than single-tap on
  selected row

- ...which is different than tap-and-hold and double tap
