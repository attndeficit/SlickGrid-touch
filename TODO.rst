Unscheduled
===========

- Update docs

- Style the example table with Bootstrap table styles


0.2, KARL Files Branch
======================

- Filtering

  - Icon in search box should come from Bootstrap Glyphicons

  - Use Bootstrap's @placeholder support for "Filter title based on
    word..."



0.1
===

- Get an icon on the sorted column header showing sort direction

- icon-chevron-up/down for column popup menu

- (fixed) Change CSS to *not* show decoration on :hover for the existing
          SlickGrid column header menu

   Question [ree]: the background went away now. I left the
   little caret (down-arrow) in the right corner. This now works
   imo consistently both in hover and in touch mode. If you find
   it better though then I can also make this one go away.

- Selected column gets a resize handle

- Tapping a row marks that row as selected, highlights the row, and
  pops up the row menu

- Row menu for "Edit" and "Delete Row"

- "Edit" menu item turns on editing on tapped cell

- "Delete Row" deletes row

- (Done) Pinch-to-resize in a column
