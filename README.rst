SlickGrid Touch
===============

A fork of the popular SlickGrid grid for JavaScript. This fork has the
following goals:

- Usable gesture support on a tablet

- Styling from Twitter Boostrap

- Deployable bundles of JS/CSS using Juicer

.. note::

    This spec focuses exclusively on tablet support. It isn't clear
    whether phones should have columns in any orientation. Without
    columns, everything is quite different.
